## Hello!

I am Jonah Hendler, a Staff Hardware Performance Engineer at IBM Z currently developing the future of mainframe caches!

My favorite languages are:
* C
* C++ (specifically C++17)
* Python

I am extremely interested in compiler design, cache development, processor design, and game development.
